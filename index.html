<p>Welcome! My Chinese name is Peiyu, also known as Orlando in English. I am a Large Language Model Engineer at Zhipu AI, specifically on the ChatGLM team. My responsibilities include the application of Large Language Models across various domains and working on intelligent agents based on LLMs.</p>

<p>My academic interests and industrial experience primarily revolve around large language models, multimodal models, and traditional NLP tasks. Before joining Zhipu AI, I worked at Baidu's Erine Bot and XiaoHongShu (Little Red Book).</p>

<p>I have previously been responsible for two major projects at XiaoHongShu:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Brand Linking Project:</strong> In this project, XiaoHongShu, a UGC content distribution platform similar to Instagram, established connections between brands in Taobao/Amazon and brands that appeared in multimodal notes. This involved a complex alignment task and greatly facilitated the connection between content and e-commerce.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multimodal Classification Project:</strong> In this task, we classified multimodal notes into over 300 categories with an accuracy rate exceeding 92%. After integrating this into the recommendation pipeline, the overall CTR (Click-Through Rate) increased by 0.2%.
  </li>
</ol>
